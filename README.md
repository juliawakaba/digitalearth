# Region: Lake Nakuru, Kenya

## Introduction
The great lakes of the Rift valley located in Kenya have been experiencing an increase in water levels in the past few years. My area of interest is one of the lakes, Lake Nakuru, as it is close to my hometown. Some fun facts about Lake Nakuru include:
- It is located in the county of Nakuru, Kenya
- It is located inside Lake Nakuru National Park
- It was previously the home to 1000s of flamingoes hence gained the name ‘Pink Lake’ from the locals
- It is a salt water lake

Over the years, we have seen the migration of flamingoes away from the lake. This is because the lake has had fresh water flow into it and this has led to the death of the algae, which flamingoes feed on. The previous game park entrance has been closed and shifted to another part of the national park as the increased water has already obstructed the gate entrance preventing tourists from accessing the national park from that entrance.
